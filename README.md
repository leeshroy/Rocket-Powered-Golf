RPG: ROCKET POWERED GOLFING - BIRDIE APOCALYPSE
The world is DEAD. Civilisation? 99% wiped out by EVIL BIRDS, hellbent on ending mankind once and for all... Your only chance at survival? GOLF! Oh but this isnt just normal golf, ITS APOCALYPSE GOLF BABY! Your club isnt a tool - its a ROCKET POWERED WEAPON of rebellion and justice! So strap on your ergonomic gloves, its time to smash some birds.

Slap explosive charges onto your golf balls to change their trajectory mid-air. Charges come in many different flavors: add a curve to your trajectory, or send your ball rushing down like an air strike. Blast obstacles to dust, send rivals flying, and leave nothing but smoldering craters where greens used to be.

This isn’t just golf. It’s survival. It’s chaos. It’s ROCKET-POWERED ARMAGEDDON. Are you going to be bird food or prove that the top of the food chain wields a 9-iron?
